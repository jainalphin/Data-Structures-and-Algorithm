# Searchin Alogrithm
## 1. Binary Search
Binary search follows divide and conquer approach in which, the list is divided into two halves and the item is compared with the middle element of the list. If the match is found then, the location of middle element is returned otherwise, we search into either of the halves depending upon the result produced through the match.
## 2. Sequetnial Search
Linear search is a very simple search algorithm. In this type of search, a sequential search is made over all items one by one. Every item is checked and if a match is found then that particular item is returned, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data collection.


# Sorting Algorithm
## 2. Insertion Sort
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time.

## 3. Selection Sort
Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is an in-place comparison-based algorithm in which the list is divided into two parts, the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end. Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part is the entire list.

## 4 Quick Sort
A large array is partitioned into two arrays one of which holds values smaller than the specified value, say pivot, based on which the partition is made and another array holds values greater than the pivot value.

## 5 Merge Sort
Merge sort is a sorting technique based on divide and conquer technique. With worst-case time complexity being ÎŸ(n log n), it is one of the most respected algorithms.

# Data Sturcture
## 1. Stack
 It follow LIFO methodology.LIFO stands for Last-in-first-out. Here, the element which is placed (inserted or added) last, is accessed first. In stack terminology, insertion operation is called PUSH operation and removal operation is called POP operation.
 
 ## 2 Queue 
 Queue follows First-In-First-Out methodology, i.e., the data item stored first will be accessed first.
 
 ## 3. LinkedList
 Linked List is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked list is the second most-used data structure after array. Following are the important terms to understand the concept of Linked List.
 
 ## 4 Doubly LinkedList
 Doubly Linked List is a variation of Linked list in which navigation is possible in both ways, either forward and backward easily as compared to Single Linked List.
